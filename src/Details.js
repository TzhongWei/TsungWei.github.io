    title: "SL Block Interwoven Structure: Procedural Design and Shape Parser",
    image: ProjectFig_18_2,
    description: [
      <p>
        Sustainable and efficient building solutions in architectural design are
        essential, particularly as{" "}
        <strong>modular and reconfigurable approaches</strong> support
        cradle-to-cradle principles and help reduce waste. Interwoven
        structures, which have roots in traditional craftsmanship, are a proven
        method for enhancing{" "}
        <strong>system integrity and structural stability</strong> through
        topological interlocking between components. <strong>SL Blocks</strong>,
        serving as the fundamental building units with six possible assembly
        configurations, can form various structural components across
        hierarchical levels. This approach aligns with modular design, as
        rule-based generation determines the configuration and relationships
        between components.
      </p>,
      <p>
        This research presents a novel <strong>computational framework</strong>{" "}
        for designing interwoven structures using SL Blocks. Leveraging the six
        transformations and grammatical approaches, this method allows for
        self-supporting, complex assemblies without adhesives or mechanical
        fasteners. In the <strong>rule-based generation</strong> phase, a base
        surface—characterised by height variations and weaving patterns—serves
        as the input. This surface is transformed into interwoven structures,
        divided into voxels and paths to guide the SL Block configuration. To
        streamline the generation of interwoven assemblies, a Rhino
        <strong>Grasshopper-compatible parser</strong> was developed, which
        verifies syntax, tokenises values into a hierarchical model using an LL
        parser, and creates seamless interwoven panels that match the designated
        surface area.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The <strong>assembly strategy phase</strong> involves segmenting
        components into smaller units and establishing an ordered sequence for
        their assembly. The <strong>versatility and scalability</strong> of SL
        Blocks in creating interwoven structures are demonstrated through
        various design hierarchies formed by aggregating SL Blocks. These
        hierarchies and recursive stacking reveal the potential to scale up to
        larger building elements, enabling the construction of substantial
        structures from numerous smaller elements and advancing the efficiency
        and innovation of modular architecture.

    description: [
      <p>
        This research focuses on enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of
        constructing <strong>dry-stacking structures</strong> using{" "}
        <strong>SL blocks</strong> by developing a method for{" "}
        <strong>parallel construction</strong>. Drawing inspiration from M.C.
        Escher’s woodcut prints of the Tower of Babel and Filippo Brunelleschi’s
        helical herringbone brickwork in the Duomo di Firenze, this study
        presents tower structures designed for concurrent assembly by
        independent working units. SL blocks, octo-cubes intended for
        dry-stacking, create interlocking structures that require{" "}
        <strong>minimal communication</strong> between units. The assembly
        process involves precise sequencing of components, with temporary
        support added as needed. A key challenge is enabling multiple
        independent units to{" "}
        <strong>build these interlocking structures simultaneously</strong>.
      </p>,
      <p>
        To address this, the study introduces a{" "}
        <strong>computational framework</strong> that uses{" "}
        <strong>grammar</strong> to define interlocking relationships,
        generating <strong>patterns for constructing tower structures</strong>.
        This grammar serves as a{" "}
        <strong>conceptual construction methodology</strong>, outlining
        transformational relationships between structural features and the
        strategic placement of SL blocks. The assembly framework allows each
        working unit to interpret construction progress{" "}
        <strong>independently and respond autonomously</strong>, fostering an
        intuitive construction process. Additionally, an{" "}
        <strong>
          algorithm automates the selection of candidate blocks for parallel
          assembly
        </strong>
        , ensuring collision avoidance and structural stability. Physical models
        of SL block towers were assembled and tested, evaluating various tower
        configurations to determine the feasibility and limitations of the
        proposed parallel construction methods.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Finally, we assembled physical models of SL block towers using
        dry-stacking techniques. We tested various tower configurations to
        evaluate their feasibility and limitations, which allowed us to refine
        strategies for parallel construction that require minimal reliance on
        direct communication.

        This research explores the potential of{" "}
        <strong>procedural modeling</strong> to create design and assembly
        sequences for interwoven panel systems. The primary objective is to
        develop a computational framework enabling architects and designers to
        conceptualize and construct interwoven assemblies through{" "}
        <strong>rule-based generation with attribute grammar</strong>. This
        study investigates how procedural modeling can effectively generate
        design and assembly sequences for interwoven panels in architectural
        applications.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The methodology unfolds in two stages. First, the interwoven module was
        developed, with each component kinematically constrained based on its
        geometrical characteristics. Three types of interwoven components were
        created—straight and two types of turnings—sharing a common connection
        system. Second, production rules for assemblies were defined with
        practical applications of attribute grammar. The results indicate that
        attribute grammar is effective in managing rule-based generated
        assemblies, using attributes as semantics to control transformations and
        block placements. This approach offers architects and designers a robust
        computational toolkit for rule-based generation and assembly of
        interwoven panels, advancing complex geometric design within
        architectural practice.

    title: "Small Architectural Business Model Game with Tico Blocks",
    image: ProjectFig_11_2,
    description: [
      <p>
        This game was developed as part of{" "}
        <strong>Professor ShenGuan Shih’s BIM classes</strong>
        to teach students about the business model in{" "}
        <strong>
          the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry
        </strong>
        . To further test its effectiveness, this module was also applied in one
        of my lectures at the National University of Kaohsiung. The primary goal
        of this game-based business model was to help students understand how
        gathering information early in the design process leads to more informed
        design decisions.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Professor Shih often likens architectural decision-making to a path
        connecting starting points with target goals, such as budget,
        environmental control, and overall building performance. Designers often
        aim for a direct path to achieve these goals, yet following a
        straightforward route can sometimes be too tedious. As a result,
        designers create more complex paths to explore different design options.
        However, this approach has its risks; if designers make decisions
        without evaluating each step thoroughly, they may encounter costly
        issues, needing additional resources, time, and budget to adjust and
        correct the design trajectory.
      </p>,
      <p>
        This game focuses on teaching students to identify and analyse essential
        information early in the design phase. For instance, students assessed
        heat insulation and building costs initially, prompting them to consider
        adjustments early on. They also plannned material usage, which impacted
        insulation and cost, and participate in simplified site bidding
        exercises to simulate real-world conditions. These choices affected the
        income generated from their designs, with closer alignment to optimal
        choices yielding better results. Various factors were integrated to
        challenge students’ decision-making.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Ultimately, this game-based exercise showed that students not only
        grasped the AEC business model but also produced better design outputs
        from the initial stages.

    description: [
      <p>
        This project was part of the fabric-forming shells research led by my
        PhD labmate, <strong>Felicia Wagiri</strong>. My role was to help
        develop a program to determine <strong>principal curvatures</strong> on
        a surface, which would then subdivide the surface into grids to
        facilitate shell structure formation.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Traditionally, principal curvature algorithms approximate orientation by
        calculating the largest and smallest curvature directions from the
        previous point. If the distance between points is sufficient, a curve
        can be derived. However, our lab explored an alternative algorithm.
        Since points on a principal curvature curve share the same normal
        vector, we refined the approximation by comparing a set of options at
        each step, rather than directly relying on the preceding step’s
        direction. Users could adjust sample numbers and ranges, selecting the
        smallest normal vector difference through a dot product with the
        original point.This new approach produced results that more accurately
        followed the principal curvature curve.

    title: "MonoTiles: Hat Tiles design",
    image: ProjectFig_13_6,
    description: [
      <p>
        The <strong>MonoTile: Hat</strong> is a unique tile shape within the
        realm of geometric tiling, introduced as part of a groundbreaking
        discovery in mathematical tiling theory. Known as an
        <strong> "aperiodic monotile"</strong> or "einstein tile," the Hat is a
        single tile shape that can cover a plane without creating a repeating
        pattern. This property makes it a notable discovery because, unlike
        traditional tiling patterns, the Hat's arrangement is
        <strong>non-repeating and aperiodic</strong>, meaning that while it
        fills the plane, it never repeats the same configuration across the
        entire surface.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Developed in recent years by a team of mathematicians, including
        <strong>
          David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim
          Goodman-Strauss,
        </strong>
        the Hat tile has captivated both researchers and enthusiasts. It
        challenges longstanding assumptions about tiling, offering insights into
        both <strong>mathematics and materials science</strong> due to its
        implications for quasicrystals and non-repeating patterns. The Hat
        tile's shape, resembling a hat, can be arranged in numerous
        configurations while maintaining a distinct lack of periodicity, making
        it a fascinating subject in{" "}
        <strong>mathematics, design, and architecture.</strong>
      </p>,
      <p>
        This unique property of the Hat tile has implications for various
        fields, especially in <strong>design applications</strong> where
        non-repetitive patterns are desirable, as well as in material sciences
        where understanding aperiodic tiling can inform the creation of novel
        materials and structures.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In response, our lab developed a Grasshopper plugin to streamline design
        with the Hat tile. This plugin allows designers to create patterns and
        geometries within the Hat tile’s framework, with options to set specific
        arrangement types—<strong>H, T, P, and F</strong>—which can be tailored
        to user requirements.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Using the plugin, <strong>Fatmat</strong> designed a variety of
        patterns, including
        <strong>curved and Islamic-inspired styles.</strong> She also applied it
        to configure a global map, where the tiles represented{" "}
        <strong>mountains and valleys</strong> arranged according to altitude.
        Additionally, <strong>Kevin Harsono</strong> used the plugin to design{" "}
        <strong>curtain walls</strong>, developing a structural framework to
        support the unique tile arrangements.

    title: "Information Scape : Agent-Based Model",
    image: ProjectFig_14_1,
    description: [
      <p>
        Access to information greatly influences individual decision-making. The
        concept of <strong>information scape</strong>, introduced by our lab’s
        PhD student <strong>Ye Yint Aung</strong>, examines how people behave in
        response to different information scenarios. This research focuses on
        the visual domain and how individuals gather information in a space to
        decide on destinations, using{" "}
        <strong>Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)</strong> to simulate behaviors within
        complex systems.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Imagine navigating to a location within a space: typically, we look for
        the closest path to our destination. However, the path is often
        indirect, potentially obstructed by walls or other dynamic elements.
        Without an internal map, we rely on signs and cues along the way, all
        within the limitations of our visual range. Additionally, we may have
        other tasks to accomplish before reaching our main destination. Given
        these variables, our daily navigation is influenced by multiple factors
        and pieces of information that lead to different outcomes. Observing and
        categorizing each person’s actions would be overwhelming due to the
        complexity, so we simplify these behaviors, applying theoretical
        frameworks to study how agents would likely act in such settings.
      </p>,
      <p>
        For example, we often manage tasks using a{" "}
        <strong>stacking approach</strong>: when a new task appears, it’s added
        to the stack (pushed), and we only move to another task once the current
        one is completed (popped). Our goal-oriented behaviors are also
        well-represented by a <strong>discrete probability model</strong>. To
        simulate individual decision-making across multiple tasks, we employ
        Markov Chains. A key aspect of this study is the
        <strong> propagation of information</strong> to various targets within
        the space, requiring agents to gather information dynamically as they
        move. To facilitate this, we apply the{" "}
        <strong>Dijkstra algorithm</strong> to calculate and distribute target
        distances for each individual agent.

    description: [
      <p>
        Since <strong>Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC)</strong> offers
        superior fluidity compared to other concrete types, it allows for
        detailed casting patterns. Additionally, its exceptional durability and
        strength increase the reusability of components. With these qualities in
        mind, Professor ShenGuan Shih aimed to promote UHPC within Taiwan's AEC
        industry, where concrete remains the primary construction material.
      </p>,
      <p>
        One effective way to showcase UHPC’s benefits is through creating
        <strong> handcrafted or small items</strong> that people can easily
        display on their desks. This led to the concept for the project: using a
        regular triangle as the foundational shape, allowing it to be assembled
        into various platonic forms and solids. We designed the 12 animals of
        the Chinese Zodiac onto these pieces, encouraging people to collect the
        full set. Each panel connects with the others using magnetic joints,
        forming a cohesive display when fully assembled.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In this project, YuChun and I were responsible for fabricating the
        panels. We used an SLA 3D printer to create the female mold and then
        made the final mold out of silicone. Afterward, we sent the molds to
        Global Reengineering Co. Ltd. for casting in UHPC. Once the pieces were
        cast, we attached magnets to the joints, completing the product.

    title: "Dual Images Wall",

    description: [
      <p>
        This project was initiated by <strong> Iuan Kai Fang</strong>, a PhD
        student in our lab and design director at <strong>KEA CREATIVE.</strong>{" "}
        The objective was to design a <strong>feature wall</strong> for the
        College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Tsing
        Hua University. The college wanted a tribute wall to honor their former
        president, displaying both his portrait and his well-known theory.
        Inspired by <strong>water jet cutting techniques</strong> on Ultra High
        Performance Concrete (UHPC) and light grating, we created a design with
        engravings and triangular protrusions to reveal two distinct images from
        different viewing angles.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the initial design phase, we used Grasshopper to analyse each pixel’s
        color code, translating this data into depth variations for the
        engraving slots on the wall's surface. We experimented with different
        engraving shapes, like trapezoids and triangles, to determine the most
        effective profiles. The <strong>angle of the triangular faces </strong>
        on the protrusions was carefully analysed to optimise the viewing
        perspective, enhancing the visibility of each image based on inclination
        ratios. In the final design phase, we fine-tuned parameters and rotated
        the engraving patterns to ensure the images would appear clearly from
        specific angles.
      </p>,
      <p>
        With support from <strong>Global Reengineering Co. Ltd.</strong>, we
        developed a mold and successfully cast the concrete wall. The
        engravings, ranging from one to five millimeters in width, presented
        challenges in retaining the fine details after the concrete solidified.
        We used a wooden female mold to capture the image patterns, assembling
        the triangular faces to create an integrated mold that displayed the
        final images as intended.

      <p>
        This was an <strong>industrial collaboration project </strong>with
        ZhenXi Construction Company in Taiwan. Our task was to design curtain
        walls on the balcony of the company’s rooftop.{" "}
        <strong>UHPC (Ultra-High Performance Concrete)</strong> was chosen for
        its excellent flexibility, durability, and strength to create a hollow
        effect for the panels. The developer desired a Japanese
        landscape-inspired design, with an emphasis on a simple, grid-based
        pattern. Additionally, our professor aimed to integrate modular
        component design and reusable masonry concepts. A full cast grid wall
        was not used; instead, we implemented the{" "}
        <strong>Topological Interlocking (TI) system</strong>.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The Topological Interlocking Assembly (TIA) is a dry-stacking masonry
        structure where each element is kinematically constrained by its
        neighboring components up to the system's edge. This makes{" "}
        <strong>border strength </strong>critical for stability. TIA also allows
        for self-alignment of individual elements, minimising errors without
        adhesives. Even with cracks or missing pieces, up to a quarter of the
        elements, the system remains functional and prevents collapse, making it
        ideal for this project.
      </p>,
      <p>
        We developed several prototypes. To enhance tensile strength between
        components and the border, we applied post-tensioning techniques,
        inspired by “The Flat Vault” method. We also added interlocking keys at
        the borders to reduce shear forces and experimented with Truchet tiling
        for rotational patterns. Additionally, we proposed block shapes like the
        '井' design. We printed them out with 3D printers to Test the feasbility
        of the designed components, and even cast it with full scale model.
        Overall, this was my first project during my master’s program and an
        exciting opportunity to realise design concepts through a dry-stacking
        structural system and UHPC.

        <strong>Reusable component design</strong> continues to be a critical
        research area in both <strong>the AEC industry</strong> and
        architectural education. Tico blocks, a type of small building block
        system developed in Taiwan, are used as an educational tool to help
        students practice component-based design. However, due to the limited
        types of Tico components, my labmate, Sprout, and I were asked by Prof.
        Shih to assist in developing a small Grasshopper 'GH' program to
        generate Tico joints on custom blocks. By using this shared interface
        between components, customised Tico blocks could be created with GH
        modeling and then 3D printed to complete student projects.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The main challenge of this project was aligning shared interfaces on
        target planar surfaces and adjusting joint positions, allowing students
        to attach Tico joints in various orientations. This flexibility enabled
        the
        <strong>blocks to be stacked in multiple directions</strong>.
        Additionally, after the studio session, these Tico-based components
        could be easily reassembled, as they utilise dry joints and a shared
        interface system, supporting the concept of design for reuse within a
        circular economy. This project provided an engaging way to explore
        sustainable design principles through reusable components.

      <p>
        Inspired by modular design principles and test concrete modules from our
        university's Department of Civil and Construction Engineering, this
        project seeks to develop a{" "}
        <strong>
          modular casting system for Osteomorphic Interlocking (OI) Blocks using
          Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC).
        </strong>{" "}
        We employed 3D printing (FDM) and CNC machining to fabricate the molds
        for this exercise.
      </p>,
      <p>
        To optimise the casting process for the OI blocks, we planned to cast
        them in batches. Reusability of the mold was also a primary objective,
        leading us to select a decomposable mold. However, because the OI block
        belongs to the topological interlocking block category, conventional
        removal methods were unsuitable. The challenge was in safely removing
        the mold along the interlocking faces. To address this, we designed a
        mold that disassembles from its interlocking surfaces. We further
        incorporated slots to secure the mold and minimise concrete leakage
        during casting. Additionally, we embedded 3D-printed pipes within the
        mold to create channels, allowing for easy post-casting assembly of the
        components.

        This design project was initiated by <strong>Iuan Kai Fang</strong>, a
        PhD student in our lab and design director at{" "}
        <strong>KEA CREATIVE</strong>. Due to the pandemic, most exhibitions had
        to transition online, and he approached me to design a virtual
        exhibition for Rotary, a global organisation.

      <p>
        The design concept featured{" "}
        <strong>layers of ellipses and gears </strong> forming the top of the
        exhibition space. Between these layers, we incorporated a space frame
        and lighting to enhance the structure’s depth. The final model was
        prepared for online display, utilising VR technology. We worked through
        various discussions to refine the visual effects and details of the
        model to ensure an immersive virtual experience.

        This was an internship project with{" "}
        <strong>Global Reengineering Company Limited</strong> , where we
        assisted in optimizing the{" "}
        <strong>Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC)</strong>
        curtain panel design for DAKA, a development on Taiwan's east coast. The
        project was developed by <strong>Taiwan Cement Corporation</strong>, one
        of Taiwan's largest cement companies, with the building designed by
        <strong> Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates (KPF)</strong>, an international
        architectural firm based in the U.S.
      </p>,
      <p>
        Due to the curved surface of the building and stair arrangements, the
        project required<strong> over 200 unique panel types</strong>, which
        significantly increased construction costs and resulted in substantial
        mold waste. Our objective was to optimize the panel shapes and reduce
        the number of unique UHPC components to enhance mold reusability,
        thereby minimizing waste and reducing costs.
      </p>,
      <p>
        We analysed the KPF model, designed as a column trimmed by the building
        and stairs. The surface was divided into three nearly equal sections
        from top to bottom and further split into 142 rows. By vectorizing the
        shapes based on properties like angle and area, we grouped them using
        <strong>K-means clustering</strong> within a tolerance of two
        centimeters, as specified by KPF. The panels were replaced with central
        vectors, and each component was reformed according to its design
        concept. To reduce panel weight, we maintained a thickness of three
        centimeters and added ribs to increase strength.
      </p>,
      <p>
        In the mold design phase, we used <strong>Euler Angles</strong> to
        determine the optimal casting orientation, ensuring a clean surface
        finish. We aligned the panels consistently for casting by orienting them
        onto a shared base mold using the calculated angles to create outer
        molds.
      </p>,
      <p>
        The project spanned two years, involving extensive communication among
        the developer, architects, and construction teams, with information
        flowing between the U.S. and Taiwan. Various algorithms were used to
        analyse panel shapes, structural similarities, and configurations. The
        experience was highly valuable, providing meaningful insights into
        practical design optimisation.

For a meta-wish to be fulfilled, approval must move up through successive levels, with each Genie requiring permission from its superior. This approval then cascades back down through the same levels, forming a stacking sequence. Each Genie remains in a passive state until it receives confirmation from a superior, only then being able to proceed. This recursive interaction reflects the concepts of nested operations found in recursion and repetition systems.",

Finally, return the route and finish G.",
